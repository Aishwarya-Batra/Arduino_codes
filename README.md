This repository contains a versatile collection of Arduino codes for controlling various mechanical systems.

Includes code for mechanisms such as:
.Dribbling systems
.Feeding mechanisms
.Piston actuators,And more custom mechanical setups.

Supports multiple motor drivers, including: BTS7960,Cytron,Other common driver modules.

Provides control logic for different types of motors: DC motors (DCV),BLDC motors,Stepper motors,Servo motors.

Features projects involving:Inverse kinematics for 6-DOF robotic arms,3-wheel drive systems,Simple and complex actuation systems.

All codes are tested, modular, and easy to integrate.
